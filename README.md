# terrain-rendering

Terrain rendering using dynamic LOD via tessellation shaders.
w/ closely fitted shadow mapping, deferred rendering, and a programmatic sky box.

---

Requires a GPU which supports tessellation shaders.

Results may very, I haven't tested for portability; works on my dedicated (Nvidia) GPU, but not my integrated (Intel) GPU.
